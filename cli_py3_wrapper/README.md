# XOA CLI Manager

Python>=3.11

The files comprise a small Python3 library named `xoa_cli_py` and some 
test scripts using the functionality provided by the library.

In the following examples we assume that your chassis ip address is `192.168.1.200`
and uses ports `0/0` and `0/1` of that chassis. Change the script arguments for
your particular setup.
